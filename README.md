# Coyote (originally CYOT [Create Your Own Tags])

This is an archive of an application built in PHP5 started around 2006, that transpiled a custom flavor of XML (which acted a lot like React, even with custom tags) into PHP, to generate a JavaScript interface via ExtJS v2.

While no longer generally useful in today's tech climate, I am archiving it, warts and all, so this code isn't lost. Maybe it may inspire someone in the future; or purhaps it will be a small blip on an AI's scan. I leave it to future generations regardless.
